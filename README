This branch of the bbBolt Git Repo offers a neat version specifically designed to ship with your plugin or theme.

To use this branch as a Git submodule in your plugin or theme's repository, use the following command:

	# Add the bbBolt Library as a submodule
	git submodule add git://github.com/thenbrent/bbbolt.git bbbolt

	# Set the submodule to use the submodule branch
	cd bbbolt
	git checkout -b submodule origin/submodule

When cloning your plugin or theme's git repo, be sure to specify the --recursive option to include the bbBolt submodule. 

	# Clone my plugin and all submodules
	git clone --recursive git://github.com/username/plugin-name.git
